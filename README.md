# Data Science in Python
This repository contains the work I have done for the [Introduction to Data Science in Python course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-python). I have completed this course with a **final grade of 95.75%**.

This intermediate-level course tackles the following topics:
- Regular Expressions in Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Working with .csv files
- Basic Statistical Testing (Pearson Correlation, Paired and Independent t-test)

The course required dealing with practical Data Science problems:
- Evaluating official immunization data from CDC in 2017. (_assignment2_)
- Investigating country-wide statistics on GDP, Scientific Contributions and and Energy Supply from UN Reports (_assignment4_)
- Testing hypotheses on BIG4 sports in Unites States (_NHL_, _NFL_, _NBA_, _MLB_,) (_assignment4_)
